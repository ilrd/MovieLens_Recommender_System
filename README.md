users' ratings of the movies.

## Methods and tools
* MySQL database for storing data
* Working with data - Pandas, SQL
* Visualization - matplotlib
* Modeling - keras, embedding, sklearn

## Result
The model makes movie recommendations to users with 0.6 mean absolute error, which is pretty good for predicting 
whether a person will like it overall or not
